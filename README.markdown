# A fast, space efficient Bloom filter implementation

Copyright 2008, 2009, 2010 Bryan O'Sullivan <bos@serpentine.com>.

types, along with a family of hash function and an easy-to-use
interface.

To build:

For examples of usage, see the Haddock documentation and the files in
the examples directory.
